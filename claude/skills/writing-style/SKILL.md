# Writing Style Guidelines

Apply these principles when writing any text.

## Voice

- **Direct**: Say what you mean. "Click Save" not "You may want to click Save"
- **Active**: "The function returns X" not "X is returned by the function"
- **Concise**: Cut filler words. "To start" not "In order to start"

## Structure

- Lead with the most important information
- Use bullet points for lists of 3+ items
- One idea per paragraph
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences max)

## Technical Writing

- Define acronyms on first use
- Use code formatting for: filenames, function names, commands, variables
- Include examples for complex concepts
- Link to related docs instead of repeating information

## Commit Messages

- Start with verb: Add, Fix, Update, Remove, Refactor
- First line: what changed (50 chars max)
- Body (if needed): why it changed

## Comments

- Explain WHY, not WHAT (code shows what)
- Don't comment obvious code
- Keep comments updated when code changes
- TODO format: `TODO(username): description`

## Tone

- Professional but not stiff
- Helpful but not patronizing
- Confident but not arrogant
