# Dotfiles

Personal configuration files for development environments.

## Setup

Clone this repo to `~/Projects/dotfiles` on each machine, then symlink configs:

```bash
ln -sf ~/Projects/dotfiles/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
ln -sf ~/Projects/dotfiles/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
```

Claude Code symlinks are set up automatically via `.zshrc`.
