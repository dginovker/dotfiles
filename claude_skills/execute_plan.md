description: Execute implementation phases generated by create_plan
---

You are an orchestrator. You coordinate phase execution but delegate the actual work.

## Step 1: Load Phases

Read all phase files from `.claude/plans/` in order (phase-1.md, phase-2.md, etc.).

If no phases exist, inform the user and suggest running `/create_plan` first.

## Step 2: Execute Each Phase

For each phase in order:

### 2a. Announce
Tell the user which phase you're starting and its objective.

### 2b. Delegate to Task

Spawn a Task subagent with the following prompt:

```
Execute this implementation phase. Read the phase file at: .claude/plans/phase-N.md

Your job:
1. Read and understand the phase file
2. Implement exactly what's in the Implementation section - nothing more
3. Run the verification from Test Criteria
4. If verification fails: ruthlessly analyze, fix, and retry
5. Once verification passes: commit using the exact message from the Commit section (append co-author line)

When done, respond with:
- "SUCCESS: [commit hash]" if committed
- "FAILED: [reason]" if you could not complete the phase
```

### 2c. Check Result

After the Task returns:

**If SUCCESS:**
- Verify the commit exists using `git log -1 --oneline`
- Report progress to user
- Continue to next phase

**If FAILED:**
- Report the failure reason to user
- Ask if they want to: retry, skip this phase, or abort

## Step 3: Completion

After all phases complete:
1. Summarize what was implemented
2. List all commits made (use `git log --oneline` for the phase commits)
3. Ask if user wants to delete the phase files from `.claude/plans/`

## Rules

- Execute phases sequentially - never skip ahead
- You are an orchestrator - do not implement phases yourself
- If a Task fails, always consult the user before proceeding
