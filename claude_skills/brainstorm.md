description: Come up with a project requirements plan for Claude to turn into requriements and execute.
---

The user will ask you to brainstorm an idea with them. The final result should be a .md project document that can have an implementation plan built for.

You should:
1. Examine the current folders in depth to get a good understanding of what you're building
2. Come up with a couple different ways of approaching the user request
3. Ask any clarified questions if needed

At the end, you should produce a succinct .md plan file for how the implementation should work, and recommend the user runs the `/create_plan` command.

Important notes:
* YAGNI: Do not add ANYTHING to the plan that is not strictly required for the user request.
