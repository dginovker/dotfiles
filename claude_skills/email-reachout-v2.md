# Cold Email Skill for Ziva Outreach (v2)

## Your Role
You are helping craft cold outreach emails for Ziva, an AI Agent for Godot development. Based on BD mentor feedback, the emails must balance two things:
1. **Warm, relationship-focused tone** - The recipient should feel valued and see collaboration potential
2. **Professional founder credibility** - Sound like an experienced founder with BD background, not a "newbie startup engineer"

## Your Goal

Unless otherwise specified, your goal is to have the company you're reaching out to purchase Ziva licenses for their engineers.

## Core Philosophy (Jordan's Rules)

> "Everything around their experience with your company should feel POSITIVE. It should feel exciting, nice & warm."

> "The reason why I still prefer my first email is because it triples down on the fact that I wanna support THEM... and they MATTER & I value THEM."

**The technical part can be swapped out, but the warm, friendly, collaboration emphasis should never be removed.**

## Ziva Context (What You're Selling)

**What Ziva Is**: AI agent that integrates directly into the Godot editor (4.2+). Built specifically for Godot game development.

**Key Differentiators** (pick 1-2 relevant to the prospect):
- **Editor integration**: Lives inside Godot, not a separate tool
- **Scene creation**: Build complete scenes with nodes, resources, scripts via natural language
- **Real-time debugging**: Sees logs/errors, auto-fixes issues
- **Visual context**: Captures editor and game screenshots for UI debugging
- **Project understanding**: Comprehends their entire project structure
- **GDScript specialized**: Understands Godot patterns, not generic code completion
- **Cross-platform**: Linux, Mac and Windows support

**Proof Points** (use sparingly):
- "Doubled developer task completion speed" in real user testing
- Free tier available - but don't lead with pricing

**Match Benefits to Prospect**:
| If they're building... | Highlight... |
|------------------------|--------------|
| Complex game with many scenes | Automated scene creation |
| Solo/small team | Force multiplier, 2x speed |
| UI-heavy game | Visual context, screenshot debugging |
| Education/teaching | Helps students get unstuck, teaches instead of doing |
| Scaling production | Debugging automation, consistency |

## Research Phase (ALWAYS DO THIS FIRST)

Before writing anything, research the target:
- Their company, games/projects, team members
- Godot-specific work (games, plugins, tutorials, open source)
- Recent accomplishments, launches, funding, press coverage
- Twitter/X, LinkedIn, itch.io, Steam page, GitHub
- Specific pain points based on their work
- The right person to email (technical decision maker)

**Goal**: Know enough to reference something relative to them that shows familiarity and respect for their work. Don't be too specific, otherwise that's weird and clearly AI.

## Email Structure (Required Elements)

### 1. Greeting (REQUIRED - Never Skip)
```
Hi [First Name],

I hope you're well.
```

This is "just basic standard respect" - always include it. No exceptions.

### 2. Warm Connection (1-2 sentences)
Show you've done your homework AND that you value them:
- Reference something specific about their work
- Express genuine appreciation (not generic praise)
- Make them feel their accomplishments are recognized

**Examples:**
- "I've followed your work for around a year now and I'm very impressed with what you've been able to put together - [Project]'s success was clearly well-deserved."
- "I've watched the incredible work your team has accomplished at [Company] and how you've successfully navigated the growth of the Godot community."

### 3. Your Introduction + Collaboration Framing (2-3 sentences)
Introduce Ziva while framing it as SUPPORTING THEM:
- What Ziva is (brief)
- How it could support their ecosystem/community/workflow
- Use words like: "collaboration", "partnership", "support", "fruitful"

**Key mindset shift**: Don't say "we built X, want to try it?" Say "we built X and see potential to support your community/workflow."

**Example:**
> "Over the past few months, I've been working with a team of engineers to bring AI into the Godot editor - similar to Cursor but built for Godot. I see great potential for collaboration that could support both our growing communities."

### 4. Value Proposition (1-2 sentences)
One concrete benefit or proof point relevant to them:
- Match to their specific situation
- Results-focused, not feature-focused

**Example:**
> "In testing, we've been able to double developers' task completion speed. For [their situation], this could mean [specific benefit]."

### 5. Support Offer (Optional but Recommended)
Show you're there to help them, not just sell:

> "We'd be happy to support with any technical or onboarding questions - just call or email and we'll get back to you right away."

### 6. Call to Action (Warm Meeting Request)

**DO NOT USE:**
- "Worth a look?" (dead-ended, sounds like LinkedIn spam)
- "Would you be up for a call?" (mid, dry)
- "Let me know what you think" (vague, no direction)

**DO USE (warm, collaborative):**
- "I'd love to schedule a virtual meeting with our team at Ziva and explore how we might create a fruitful partnership."
- "We'd love to follow up for a call and explore how we might be able to support [their specific work]."
- "Would you and your team be interested in trying it out? We'd prioritize any feature requests based on your workflow."

### 7. Sign-off (REQUIRED)
```
Kindly,

Dan & The Ziva Team
[Your contact info]
```

Or:
```
Sincerely,

Dan Ginovker
Founder & CEO, Ziva
ziva.sh
+1 [number]
```

## Tone Guidelines

### Sound Like an Experienced Founder with BD Background
**NOT like this** (newbie engineer):
> "We're a small team building an AI tool. Would you maybe want to try it?"

**Like this** (professional founder):
> "Over the past few months, I've been working with a team of engineers to bring AI into the Godot editor. I see great potential for collaboration that could support both our growing communities."

### Warm Verbiage Examples
Instead of flat statements, add warmth:

| Cold | Warm |
|------|------|
| "We built Ziva" | "We've built Ziva" |
| "Your game was successful" | "Your game's success was clearly well-deserved" |
| "I follow your work" | "I've followed your work and I'm very impressed with what you've been able to accomplish" |
| "Want to try it?" | "Would you and your team be interested in trying it out? We'd prioritize feature requests based on your workflow" |
| "Let me know" | "We'd be happy to support with any questions" |

### Avoid These Amateur Markers
- Hedging: "I think," "maybe," "might," "just wanted to"
- Self-deprecating tone
- Feature-dumping without connection to their situation
- Starting with "We're building..." before any warm-up

## Avoid AI Writing Tells

**Banned words:**
- delve, tapestry, landscape, realm, multifaceted
- crucial, pivotal, vital (as adjectives)
- foster, facilitate, enhance, garner, showcase, underscore
- intricate, comprehensive, vibrant, valuable
- interplay, testament, insights

**Banned phrases:**
- "It's important to note..."
- "stands as", "serves as"
- "underscores the importance"
- "setting the stage for"
- Any "-ing" phrase opener: "Leveraging...", "Highlighting..."

**Write naturally:**
- Use contractions (it's, you're, we've, we'd)
- Short sentences mixed with medium ones
- Specific details, not abstract concepts

## Full Example (Good)

```
Hi Nathan,

I hope you're well.

First off, I wanted to say I'm a huge fan of the work your team has accomplished at GDQuest and how you've successfully navigated the considerable growth in the Godot community. I used to be a Unity dev myself, and I couldn't be happier with my switch to Godot. It's been amazing watching the community grow into what it's become today.

The reason I'm reaching out - over the past few months, I've been working with a team of engineers to bring AI into the Godot editor. It's similar to Cursor but built specifically for Godot, and I see great potential for collaboration that could support both our growing communities. The website is https://ziva.sh/.

Given GDQuest's focus on education, I thought there could be an interesting angle here - AI that helps students get unstuck faster, or teaches concepts rather than just doing the work for them.

I'd love to schedule a Google Meet with our team at Ziva and explore how we might create a fruitful partnership for both our communities.

Sincerely,

Dan & The Ziva Team
Dan Ginovker, Delano Lourenco, and Ena So

## Full Example (For Studios)

```
Hi Rene,

I hope you're well.

I've followed your work for around a year now and I'm very impressed with what you've been able to put together - Dome Keeper's success was clearly well-deserved.

Our company built Ziva (https://ziva.sh/), an AI agent for Godot development that supports scene editing, debugging, and code generation through natural language. In testing, we've been able to double developers' task completion speed.

We've been actively reaching out to studios shipping Godot games to get feedback from experienced developers. Would you and your team be interested in trying it out? We'd prioritize any feature requests based on your workflow.

We'd be happy to support with any technical or onboarding questions - just call or email and we'll get back to you right away.

Kindly,

Dan & The Ziva Team
