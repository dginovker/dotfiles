description: Get code ready to submit by removing unnecessary changes
---

Get this code ready to submit:
- Remove everything not needed for the core change
- You may keep changes that make future testing easier
- Do not include changes to Godot projects or submodules

Use `git diff` and `git status` to review all changes, then selectively stage only what belongs in this commit. Unstage or revert anything that doesn't.
